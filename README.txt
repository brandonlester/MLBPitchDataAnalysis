MLB Pitch Data Analysis
4/28/2019

Data on every pitch in the 2015 - 2018 MLB seasons is cleaned and analyzed to explore 
the distribution of pitch speeds and the proportion of pitch type used through an at bat.

The 4 data files can be found on Kaggle using the "MLB Pitch Data 2015-2018 - Kaggle.url" link.

There are 2 R scripts I used while working on the project and a
R markdown file where I implement the code from the R scripts.

The final project deliverable can be viewed online using the "RPubs - MLB Pitch Data Analysis.url" link.
